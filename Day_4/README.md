# ⚡️ Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)

Gate-Level Simulation (**GLS**) is a **critical verification step** in the VLSI design flow where the **synthesized gate-level netlist** of a digital circuit is simulated.  
It ensures that what you designed at RTL truly works at the gate level, **with real delays and test structures** ✅  

---

## ❓ What is GLS?
GLS is the process of simulating a **post-synthesis netlist** (a circuit represented as logic gates) instead of high-level RTL.  
It helps to validate the following aspects:

- 🧩 **Functional correctness** – Does the netlist behave exactly like the RTL?  
- ⏱ **Timing behavior** – Does it meet timing constraints (setup/hold)?  
- 🔋 **Power estimates** – Switching activity and power can be observed.  
- 🧪 **DFT structures** – Scan chains and test logic work correctly.  

> ⚠️ GLS is slower than RTL simulation but much more **realistic** and **trustworthy**.

---

## 💡 Why Perform GLS?
- ✅ **Synthesis Validation** → Ensures synthesis tools correctly map RTL → gates.  
- ⏳ **Timing Verification** → Detects violations using **SDF (Standard Delay Format)** back-annotation.  
- 🧬 **Testability Checks** → Verifies scan chains and DFT features.  
- 🚀 **Confidence before tape-out** → Reduces risk of silicon failure.  

---

## 🕐 When is GLS Performed?
GLS is usually done at **two critical points**:
1. **After Synthesis** – Verify RTL → Gate translation.  
2. **Before Physical Design (P&R)** – Catch timing/test issues early.  

---

## 🧭 Types of GLS
| Type             | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Functional GLS** | 🔹 Logic-only simulation (zero or unit delays). Fast but ignores real timing. |
| **Timing GLS**     | 🔹 Uses SDF annotated delays. Checks setup/hold, glitches, and real-world timing. |

---

## ⏳ Delay Annotation
GLS often uses **SDF Back-Annotation** to model **real delays** from synthesis or P&R:
- **Without annotation** → Ideal behavior, unrealistic.  
- **With SDF annotation** → Realistic timing behavior (net delays, cell delays, setup/hold).  

> 💎 This step bridges the gap between **ideal RTL sim** and **silicon reality**.

# 🧪 Lab Experiment

## 🔹Ternary Operator MUX

In this lab, we design a **2:1 Multiplexer** using the **ternary operator** in Verilog.  
The multiplexer selects one of two inputs (`i0`, `i1`) based on the control signal (`sel`) and drives it to the output (`y`).  

### 📜 Verilog Code
```verilog
// 2:1 MUX using Ternary Operator
module ternary_operator_mux (
  input  i0, 
  input  i1, 
  input  sel, 
  output y
);
  assign y = sel ? i1 : i0;
endmodule
```

# ⚡️🔀 Synthesis vs Simulation Mismatch


A **synthesis-simulation mismatch** occurs when the **simulation results of RTL (pre-synthesis)** do **not match** the **gate-level netlist (post-synthesis)** or actual hardware behavior.  

This is a critical issue in VLSI design because it can cause **functional failures after tape-out**! 🚨💣  

---

### 🔍 Common Causes of Mismatch 🕵️‍♂️

| Cause                           | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Non-synthesizable constructs** | Use of `#delays`, `initial` blocks, `real` numbers, or unsupported RTL.⛔️💀|
| **Incomplete / Ambiguous RTL**   | Missing `else` clauses, incomplete sensitivity lists, or undefined behavior.❓🌀|
| **Tool interpretation differences** | Different simulators or synthesis tools may handle ambiguous RTL differently.🛠️⚖️|
| **Incorrect assumptions**        | Timing or resource assumptions not reflected in RTL or netlist.⚡️⚠️|



### 💡 Key Points to Avoid Mismatch 🌟✨

- ✅ **Always write synthesizable RTL** – avoid unsupported constructs. 📝  
- ✅ **Use complete and unambiguous coding** – cover all branches, define all signals. ✅🔧  
- ✅ **Verify sensitivity lists** in combinational logic carefully. 🧐  
- ✅ **Run post-synthesis simulation** to catch mismatches early. ⏱️  
- ✅ **Compare RTL vs Gate-level waveforms** systematically. 📊🔍

## ⚡️ Causes of Synthesis–Simulation (S-S) Mismatch 🧩💥

Synthesis–Simulation mismatches often occur due to subtle coding issues in RTL. Understanding the causes helps **avoid functional surprises**! 🚨

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Missing Sensitivity List** | Combinational blocks without proper sensitivity lists can behave differently in simulation vs synthesized hardware.🕵️‍♂️⚡️|
| **Blocking vs Non-blocking Assignment** | Incorrect use of `=` (blocking) vs `<=` (non-blocking) in sequential logic may create mismatches in timing and ordering.🔀⏱️|
| **Non-standard Verilog Coding** | Using non-synthesizable constructs, initial blocks, or non-standard RTL may simulate correctly but fail after synthesis.❌🛠️|

Tips for Avoiding S-S Mismatch

- ✅ Always include **full sensitivity lists** in combinational logic (`always @(*)`).  
- ✅ Use **blocking assignments (`=`) for combinational**, **non-blocking (`<=`) for sequential** logic.  
- ✅ Stick to **standard synthesizable Verilog constructs**.  
- ✅ Perform **post-synthesis simulation** to catch mismatches early.
  

> 🔍 **Pro Insight:** Even small mismatches can lead to **major functional failures on silicon**! ⚡️💣

# 🌟 Bad MUX Example (Common Pitfalls) 🧩💥

Sometimes, **small RTL mistakes** lead to **synthesis–simulation mismatches**.  
Here’s an example **2:1 MUX** with intentional issues to demonstrate common pitfalls. 🚨

### 🔹 Problematic Code

```verilog
module bad_mux (
  input i0, 
  input i1, 
  input sel, 
  output reg y
);
  always @ (sel) begin
    if (sel)
      y <= i1;
    else 
      y <= i0;
  end
endmodule
```

<details> <summary>❗ Issues in this Code (click to expand)</summary>

  1. Incomplete sensitivity list – always @(sel) ignores i0 and i1, which may cause mismatches in simulation. ⚡️

  2. Non-blocking assignment in combinational logic – Using <= in combinational blocks is not recommended; should use blocking assignment =. 🔀

</details>

### ✅ Corrected Version of MUX 🔧

```verilog
always @ (*) begin
  if (sel)
    y = i1;
  else
    y = i0;
end
```
## Waveform of RTL Code Simulation of Bad Mux :

- This shows the **behavior of the original RTL MUX**.  
- Output `y` is computed based on **ideal combinational logic**.  
- No real gate delays are considered here. ⚡️  

**Observations:**

- Immediate update of output based on `sel` input.  
- Helps verify functional correctness of RTL before synthesis.

# ⚡️ Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignments in Verilog 🛠️🔄

Verilog offers **two types of procedural assignments** that behave differently depending on **combinational vs sequential logic**. ⚡️

---

## 3.1 Blocking Statements (`=`) 📝

- **Syntax:** `=`  
- **Execution:** Sequential, executes **immediately** ⏩  
- **Suitable for:** **Combinational logic** (`always @(*)`) 🔹  
- **Example:**  
```verilog
always @(*) 
  y = a & b;
```

## 3.2 Non-Blocking Statements (`<=`) ⏱️

- **Syntax:** `<=`  
- **Execution:** Scheduled, executes **concurrently** at the end of the time step 🔄  
- **Suitable for:** **Sequential logic** (`always @(posedge clk)`) 🛠️  
- **Example:**  
```verilog
always @(posedge clk) 
  q <= d;
```

---

### 3.3 Comparison Table 🆚⚡️

| **Blocking (`=`)** 📝                        | **Non-Blocking (`<=`)** ⏱️                 |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Uses `=` operator                           | Uses `<=` operator                         |
| Sequential, **immediate execution** ⏩       | Concurrent, **scheduled at end of timestep** 🔄 |
| Updates happen instantly in code order ⚡️   | Updates applied after time step ⏳          |
| For **combinational logic**, temp variables 🔹 | For **sequential logic**, registers/flip-flops 🛡️ |
| Infers **combinational logic (gates)** 🧩    | Infers **sequential logic (flip-flops)** 🔧 |

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Choosing the correct assignment type prevents **simulation vs synthesis mismatches** and ensures correct hardware behavior! 💥

# 🛠️ Lab : Blocking Assignment Caveat 🛠️

Sometimes, **blocking assignments (`=`)** can produce unexpected results if the **order of assignments** is not carefully handled. 🧩  

### 🔹 Problematic Code
```verilog
module blocking_caveat (
  input a, 
  input b, 
  input c, 
  output reg d
);
  reg x;
  always @ (*) begin
    d = x & c;
    x = a | b;
  end
endmodule
```

## What’s wrong?
- The order of assignments causes `d` to use the old value of `x`—not the newly computed value.
- **Best Practice:** Assign intermediate variables before using them.

## **Corrected order:**
```verilog
always @ (*) begin
  x = a | b;
  d = x & c;
end
```
