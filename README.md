## About This Workshop

This workshop is intended for students, hobbyists, and engineers who want to learn about:

- Verilog RTL design and simulation  
- Using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave for waveform analysis  
- Logic synthesis using **Yosys** and the **SKY130 open-source PDK**  
- Key digital design concepts: testbenches, timing libraries, D flip-flop coding styles, and optimization  

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Separate testbenches from RTL modules for clarity and reusability.  
> ⚠️ **Warning:** Avoid implicit latches to prevent synthesis issues.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of digital logic (gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, etc.)  
- Familiarity with Linux shell commands  
- Linux environment (or WSL on Windows/macOS)  
- Tools: `git`, `iverilog`, `gtkwave`, `yosys`, text editor (VS Code recommended)
