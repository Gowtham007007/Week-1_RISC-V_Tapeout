## 🌟 About This Workshop 💡

This workshop is designed for students, hobbyists, and engineers interested in:

- 🔹 Verilog RTL design and simulation  
- 🖥️ Using **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave** for waveform analysis  
- ⚡ Logic synthesis using **Yosys** and **SKY130 open-source PDK**  
- 💻 Key digital design concepts: testbenches, timing libraries, D flip-flop coding styles, and optimization  

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Separate testbenches from RTL modules for clarity and reusability.  
> ⚠️ **Warning:** Avoid implicit latches to prevent synthesis issues.

## 🔄 Design Flow ⚙️

The RTL design workflow follows these steps:

1. ✏️ **Verilog RTL Code** – Write RTL modules.  
2. 🖥️ **Simulation with Icarus Verilog** – Verify functionality using testbenches.  
3. ⚡ **Synthesis using Yosys** – Convert RTL into gate-level netlist.  
4. 🗂 **Netlist Generation** – Produce the circuit representation for verification.  
5. 🔬 **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** – Validate synthesized design.  
6. 🎯 **Optimized Design** – Apply optimizations for area, power, and performance.
