Day 5 Content (Block by Block)

1. Timing Analysis & Cell Libraries

Introduction to the role of Standard Cell Libraries (Lib files) in ASIC design.

Explanation of different corners (tt, ss, ff) and how they impact timing.

How to interpret .lib parameters such as cell delay, setup time, hold time, and power.

2. Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)

Purpose of running GLS after synthesis.

Differences between RTL Simulation and GLS.

Issues like X-propagation, uninitialized signals, and glitches visible only in GLS.

Practical flow:

Compile netlist with standard cell library.

Run testbench using Icarus Verilog.

Observe waveforms using GTKWave.

3. Synthesis Strategies

Hierarchical vs Flattened Netlist revisited with real examples.

Advantages of hierarchy in debugging and modular design.

Advantages of flattening in optimization and performance.

4. Flip-Flop Variants & Coding

Writing behavioral code for:

D Flip-Flop with Async Reset.

D Flip-Flop with Sync Reset.

D Flip-Flop with Async Set.

Emphasis on coding best practices for synthesis-friendly design.

5. Experiment & Hands-on

Run synthesis for a small sequential circuit (like an 8-bit counter).

Generate netlist and perform GLS with timing library.

Compare functional vs gate-level results.

Note down mismatches and analyze why they occur.

6. Wrap-up / Key Takeaways

Importance of timing libraries in defining real hardware behavior.

GLS ensures correctness after mapping to technology.

Hierarchical vs Flattened synthesis trade-offs.

Flip-flop coding is a foundation for larger sequential circuits.
